The `default.conf` file goes in /etc/keyd/default.conf and is a global configuration for the keyboard.

The `app.conf` file goes in ~/.config/keyd/app.conf and is user-local and application-specific configuration for the keyboard. Note that the `keyd` Gnome extension must be installed for `app.conf` to have any effect.
