# My Pop!_OS Configuration

Pop!_OS is a beautiful and functional version of Ubuntu Linux designed and developed by System76. I like it to behave like Mac OS--keyboard shortcuts in particular. This repository tracks the settings I've used.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Copy / Cut / Paste: `Cmd+C|X|V` (even in Gnome Terminal)
- Undo / Redo: `Cmd+Z`, `Cmd+Shift+Z`
- Select All: `Cmd+A`
- Close Tab: `Cmd+W`
- Save File: `Cmd+S`
- Cursor to Beginning / End of Line: `Cmd+Left|Right`
- Find / Find Next / Find Prev: `Cmd+F`, `Cmd+G`, `Cmd+Shift+G`
- Next / Prev Tab: `Cmd+Alt+Left|Right`
- Preferences: `Cmd+,`

## AutoKey

Install AutoKey from the `Pop!_Shop`. The `./autokey` directory will be copied to `~/.config/autokey/`.

## Notes

In addition to MacOS bindings, I like to have CAPS LOCK remapped:
