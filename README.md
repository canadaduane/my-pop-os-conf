# My Pop!_OS Configuration

Pop!_OS is a beautiful and functional version of Ubuntu Linux designed and developed by System76. I like it to behave like Mac OS--keyboard shortcuts in particular. This repository tracks the settings I've used.

Currently running Pop!_OS version 22.04 (beta as of this writing).
